# NeverForget
Console Appointment Calendar App in C#
Final Project for Code Kentucky Software Developement One due Nov 18, 2022
Very simple app that shows today and tomorrows appointments at the top and allows you to enter an appointment,
 search for one by date and time, delete future appointments. It also lets you write a journal entry and read your previous entries and exit.
Features:
Master Loop 
Collections(List/Database)
Write/Read/Create MyJournal file
Error messages
Multiple classes
Multiple functions (add, search, delete)
Collects and returns date/time/appointment
TryParse, If/Else,Foreach


Flaws:
No retention of information when shut down (is run by the NeverForget.csproj)
Former flaw: Thank you Carl B for helping me with code placement.
You must hit a key after the program gives you a result to make a choice from the main loop
In a future version It would be better to have the journal as an additional database to improve function and ad searchability.
